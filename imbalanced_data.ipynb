    "## Imbalanced data\n",
    "It is common to come across an imbalanced dataset while working on **classification problems** such fraud detection, spam detection, or mapping natural resource occurrences. \n",
    "An imbalanced dataset is one that contains unequal number of samples from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Severe vs. slight imbalance\n",
    "Depending on the ratio of samples belonging to the **minority** and **majority** classes, the imbalance can range from slight to severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is reasonable to treat a dataset with a slight imbalance (e.g. 2:3) as if it were normal; however, more severe cases of imbalance (e.g. 1:4 or more) need to be corrected and require extra effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "While training a model on a datset with slight imbalance, class weighting is a tool for penalizing the model for misclassified minority class samples, causing the model to pay greater attention to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does an imbalanced dataset do to a model? \n",
    "Due to the abundance of samples in the training dataset, a model that is trained on an imbalanced dataset is highly controlled by the characteristics of the majority class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because learning characteristics from a limited number of samples is challenging for the model, it performs poorly for the minority class, which may not even be reflected in a performance metric like accuracy due to the **accuracy paradox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For imbalanced datasets, metrics such as accuracy can be misleading. Instead, parameters should be used that are less sensitive to True Negative (Negative represents the dominant class) samples. It is always a good idea to look at the confusion matrix. "
